Make sure the "include" folder contain the header files for GLFW and GLEW, 
and the "lib" folder contain the .lib files for those libraries.

The dll files for GLFW and GLEW should be in the same directory as the program.

To run the code, change the paths in the makefile to point to the "include" and "lib" folder
inside this directory. Then, in terminal, type:
- make 


This will run the program and open a window that show the result.

If makefile does not work, run this command manually (change the paths correspondingly):
- g++ -g -std=c++17 -o "filename".exe -IC:\path\to\cap5705_a2\include -LC:\path\to\cap5705_a2\lib "filename".cpp -lglew32 -lglfw3dll -lopengl32


helloTriangle.cpp is for question 1
object.cpp is for question 2,3,4. benchmark.cpp is for benchmarking question 4
rotate.cpp is for question 5.
